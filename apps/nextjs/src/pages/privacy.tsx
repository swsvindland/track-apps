          I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the

        <p>
          I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have
          access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the
          tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not
          to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

          I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we
          are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.
          But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or
          method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
          guarantee its absolute security.
